# Re-doing a micro tracker join request
Your micro tracker is a LoRaWAN® OTAA device that needs to do a join request to attach the LoRaWAN® network and get a join accept from it.<br/>
If necessary, you can force a new join request for a tracker that is already joined for example to attach it to a new network. You can also use this procedure to troubleshoot and reset the tracker.
